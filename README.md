## The Aim of the Project
How can we create open and accessible datasets to tell the story of
the youth climate movements and function as interactive tools in
support of climate action?

The aim of this project was to create a digital open archive that
celebrates new narratives and to design tools and practices
that allow different audiences to explore the data, analyse the
language and be inspired to join the movements from the screens
and in the streets. 

The platform is based on a dataset that contains images from climate
demonstrations, extracted text from the Instagram and Twitter official accounts of four 
main climate movements as well as from individuals who used the official hashtags of the movements within their post :
- Extinction Rebellion  
- Fridays for Future  
- Sunrise Movement  
- Zero Hour  

## Results
In the platform users can filter and sort *images* by **movement**, **date**,
**level of engagement**, **hashtag(s)**.
The platform is designed to allow the user to explore the data on different layers
and aims to facilitate the discovery of different stories within the same
dataset. The landing page shows a birds eye view of all the images,
which celebrate the act of marching in the streets for climate justice.
